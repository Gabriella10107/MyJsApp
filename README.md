📱 About This Project

This is a mobile-first React Native application designed specifically for smartphone usage.

The interface is not intended for desktop or browser environments.

Navigation is based on user interaction and experience flow rather than traditional visible page structures.

Each screen is connected through buttons and actions, creating a guided UX journey.
