## 📖 About This Project

This is a **mobile-first** React Native application designed specifically for the intimate experience of smartphone usage. 

Unlike traditional web applications, this interface is **not intended for desktop or browser environments**. The architecture purposefully ignores standard responsive web rules to focus entirely on the ergonomics and tactile feedback of a handheld device.

## 🎯 UX-Focused Design

This project moves away from static page layouts. Instead, the experience is built around a dynamic flow where the structure becomes meaningful only through active engagement.

### Key Design Pillars:
* **Action-Based Navigation:** Moving through the app isn't about clicking links; it's about triggering transitions that feel natural to the thumb.
* **Emotional UX Flow:** The "feeling" of the app changes as the user interacts, creating a guided journey rather than a simple utility.
* **Interaction-Driven Transitions:** Each screen is connected through specific buttons and gestures, ensuring the user is never lost, but always "led."

> **Developer Note:** The logic of this app is understood through usage. There is no traditional visible page hierarchy—the hierarchy is created by the user’s own journey through the screens.

## ⚠️ Important Deployment Notes

To maintain the integrity of the design, please note the following technical constraints:

* **Non-Responsive:** This app is **not responsive for desktop**. Opening this in a standard browser will not represent the intended experience.
* **Optimal Environment:** To truly "feel" the UX transitions and gesture logic, please run this on:
    * **Physical Mobile Device** (iOS/Android)
    * **Android Emulator / iOS Simulator**
